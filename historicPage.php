                    Haarlem is very old city with a turbulent history and great sites to see. The city is full of culture and art, there are many museums you could visit, such as the Frans Hals museum, Teylers museum, museum van de Geest and of course many more! Besides museums, Haarlem had amazing architecture. The St. Bavo church is a beautiful church from the late middle ages, it is build in a gothic style which originated from Brabant. And to get a real feel of the Dutch culture, Molen de Adriaan is located in Haarlem.
                    So if you are interested in (Dutch) culture, the Historic tour is definitely something for you!
